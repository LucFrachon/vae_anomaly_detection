# Anomaly detection using a Variational Auto-Encoder

This is a project I started to study how VAEs could be used to perform anomaly detection. I then fleshed it out with details and figures and decided to make it public in the hope that it might help others too. The original notebook was developped on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/lucfrachon/anomaly-detection-using-vaes).
