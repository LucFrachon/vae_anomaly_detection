# Anomaly detection using a Variational Auto-Encoder

This is a project I started to study how VAEs could be used to perform anomaly detection. I then fleshed it out with details and figures and decided to make it public in the hope that it might help others too. The original notebook was developped on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/lucfrachon/anomaly-detection-using-vaes).

Tested with the following package versions:
- Pytorch: 1.4.0
- Pytorch-Lightning: 1.0.7
- Matplotlib: 3.1.3
- scikit-learn: 0.22.2.post1
- Weights&Biases: 0.8.32
